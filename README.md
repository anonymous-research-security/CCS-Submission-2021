# MobiCom-Submission-2022
This repository contains the following supplementary documents/files associated with the paper submission to MobiCom 2022.
1. An Android testing app (included in the file named wifitestapi29.tar.gz) incorporated with WifiManager.addNetworkSuggestions API (Section 4.1).
2. The full report on the identified weaknesses in WifiManager APIs (Section 4.3).
3. The supporting documents associated with our identified weaknesses (Section 4.4). 

In particular, we add the supporting documents according to our revision plan approved by the shepherd. We release the available bug reports and acknowledgement with proper anonymization, together with reports to reproduce the attack resulted from our identified weak points. We include three sub-folders inside the **Supporting Document** folder. In folder **Reports and Acknowledgements**, we include the reports and responses from Google. Due to the legal concerns with respect to intellectual property, we are still communicating with the respective smart phone manufacturers involved with our CVEs, regarding the release of their acknowledgement. We will do so upon their approval. In folder **Reproduction Reports**, we provide reports for reproducing the attacks resulted from the 3 weak points. They are part of the bug report we send to Google and other manufacturers. The involved configuration files can be found in folder **Configuration Files**.
